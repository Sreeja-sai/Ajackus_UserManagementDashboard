ðŸ“Š User Management Dashboard â€“ Ajackus Assignment

ðŸ”Ž Overview

The User Management Dashboard is a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application developed as part of the Ajackus assignment.
It provides a clean and intuitive interface for managing users, including their name, email, and department details.

This project demonstrates:

React.js frontend development skills

Integration with RESTful backend APIs

State management and dynamic UI updates

Backend development using Node.js, Express.js, and SQLite

The app is designed to showcase real-world user management functionality similar to what is found in admin dashboards.

ðŸš€ Features

User Listing: View all registered users in a table format

Add User: Add new users with name, email, and department

Edit User: Update details of an existing user

Delete User: Remove users from the database

Form Validation: Ensures users cannot be added with incomplete details

Responsive Design: Works smoothly on different screen sizes

Separation of Concerns: Clear separation between frontend and backend
